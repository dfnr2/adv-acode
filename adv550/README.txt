This is an original Dave Platt's A-code source of the 550 points version
of Adventure, very slightly adapted to work with my A-code engine (the
block of DEFINEs shifted to precede any executable code). 

To create the Adv550 executable, you will need acdc (the A-code to C
translator) and the adventure kernel (advkern.c and advkern.h). All
need to be at version 11 or higher. All of these are supplied with this
bundle.

The only other requirement is an ANSI C compiler.

This directory contains:
