This is the A-code source of my Adv660, combining (with some extensions)
Luckett's and Pike's Adv440 and Dave Platt's Adv550.  The source is
provided under GPL (the GNU Public Licence).

The game is written in my version of the A-code language, originally
developed by Dave Platt for adv550. A guide to A-code is available
as http://www.mipmip.demon.co.uk/adv/acode.html

To create the Adv660 executable, you will need acdc (the A-code to C
translator) and the adventure kernel (advkern.c and advkern.h). All
need to be at version 11 or higher. All of these are supplied with this
bundle.

The only other requirement is an ANSI C compiler.

This directory contains:
